## The Challenge

According to Porsche and Boeing, **commercial passenger drones will enter the market around 2025**.[^1] But aside from the eccentric millionaires who may purchase these vehicles for private use, how will the general public be able to access these vehicles? Will there be sufficient interest to support incorporating these vehicles into existing public transit systems? Are people willing to shell out to have a vehicle pick them up at their door and take them to their destination on demand? I needed to **explore different value propositions and business models to find a way these vehicles could be made accessible to the general public**, namely those working or living in the city of Los Angeles.

### Get to Know the Customers {#customers}

There is only so much you can learn about customers needs and goals by reading about LA transportation online. 
I **developed a provisional persona based on my online research**, but I needed to know more about what everyday people expected from these futuristic modes of transportation. 
Would they anticipate them working like modern public transit, coming and going from common stops, or would they expect them to be more like Uber, calling up a vehicle on demand? 
To answer this question, **I hit the streets of downtown Los Angeles to catch my would-be customers and ask them some questions** to learn more about their current transportation experience and their expectations for the future of LA transit. 
My customer discovery process included 10 individuals. I found that 40% of those interviewed thought that flying vehicles would work like modern public transit while 60% thought they would call up a vehicle like they would an Uber.

Based on the information I gathered during the interviews, I was also able to **fine-tune my persona**, which would be critical to designing an app that addressed real user needs and behaviors. Meet the efficient millennials. They worry about the safety of these flying vehicles but also know that they're not very far off in the future. The like to relax or work while in transit and need quick and affordable ways to get around, even if it means carpooling occasionally.

Though I would have loved to talk to even more people to confirm my findings, **this was enough data for me to get started shaping a solution that I could get in front of more people**. But first I had to make sure I was developing a unique solution. To do that, I needed to look at the current marketplace.

### Analyze the Competition {#competition}

Armed with an understanding of the problems faced by my persona and their interest in my value proposition, I moved on to conducting a competitive analysis. Though the technology is still a ways off, there was a surprisingly large existing market for autonomous flying vehicles (both the manufacturing and design of the vehicles themselves as well as solutions for bringing the technology to the public). I **evaluated 3 direct competitors and 5 indirect competitors**, comparing their funding, revenue streams, prototypes demonstrated, competitive advantages, customer reviews (where appropriate), and more. **The biggest competitor to this value proposition of "Uber for Autonomous Flying Vehicles" was, unsurprisingly, Uber itself**. With $24.7 billion in funding and an enormous existing customer base, Uber Air (also called Uber Elevate) was a formidable competitor.

However, they were planning to charge customers $5 per mile to fly, which would be inaccessible for many of Los Angeles commuters. Because Uber Air was not addressing the needs of the budget-conscious customer, I decided to pivot on my value proposition. 
By **moving away from Uber for flying autonomous vehicles and transitioning to an autonomous flying shuttle system with lower flat rates and discount passes**, I was better able to **address the needs of more budget-conscious customers**.

This change in value proposition **stemmed from the strong interest during customer discovery** in these vehicles functioning like modern public transportation and **differentiated this app** from the rest of the market. Satisfied that the new value proposition was sufficiently unique in the marketplace, I began creating a high-fidelity prototype to get in front of potential customers.

### Design a High-Fidelity Prototype {#prototype}

Using Adobe XD, I crafted a high-fidelity prototype that would walk a customer through the experience of taking a flight as part of a multi-modal route. I **looked at relevant UX influencers, such as Uber, Lyft, and CityMapper** because I wanted to include familiar features to help customers adjust to incorporating this new technology into their routes. This process led me to include a detailed route overview as well as easy payment options and clear boarding directions.

**Needing to test the pricing model, I provided options for paying for a single ride as well as buying week and month passes**. To test the app with potential customers, I also needed to **give it a name and logo**. I chose "Volamos" since it is Spanish for "we fly" and selected a paper airplane as the logo to convey these ease and excitement with which someone could ride in an autonomous flying vehicle.

With a working prototype, I felt prepared to evaluate my value proposition and business model with potential customers. As great as I felt the prototype was, **I needed to conduct user research to determine if the product was something real people would want or need**.

### Conduct Online User Research {#research}

The prototype was completed in March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic struck in Los Angeles. **For the first time, I had to conduct my user research entirely online**. 

#### Qualitative Research: One-on-One Interviews {#research1}
I turned to Facebook groups of people living in Los Angeles to recruit participants. I used a Qualtrics survey with timed screener questions to find people who fit my persona and scheduled 5 participants for individual 30 minute interviews over Zoom.

My hypotheses were that participants would need or want the solution, that they would prefer the subscription-based pricing model over other options, and that they would find the listed prices agreeable. I set my success criteria at 80%, meaning 4 out of 5 participants would need to confirm each hypothesis for me to move forward with this value proposition and business model. **80% of participants confirmed that they needed or wanted this solution and that they liked the subscription-based pricing model, but 0% agreed with the listed prices, so I swapped expensive unlimited ride passes for cheaper membership options**.

Also, participants were confused by the app's name and logo. They felt that the futuristic transportation option needed stronger branding that inspired more confidence with a logo that looked more like those of other transportation apps.

I updated the prototype to include the new membership option (inspired by the perks of Lyft's membership program), **redesigned the logo and shortened the name to "Vola," and provided some clearer in-app guidance** where participants had stumbled.

To further evaluate the value proposition, I needed to get the app in front of more than just 5 people, so I decided to run an experiment with a much larger sample size. About 500 times larger.

#### Quantitative Research: A/B Testing with Online Advertisements {#research2}

I ran two advertising campaigns on Facebook narrowing in even further on who my potential customers were before I realized that what I really **needed to know was why my potential customers would want to use this app**. Was it really for commuting as I had imagined? Or would it be for the experience of flying? **Understanding this driving force for customers would help me curate the user experience appropriately and influence future marketing decisions**: what route information would be conveyed, how the app could be advertised after development, etc. To answer this question, I created two different advertisements linked to Unbounce landing pages. One ad referred to the app as a chance to book a one-off experience while the other referenced using it as part of a regular commute.

<div class="caption"><i>Facebook advertisements used for A/B testing value proposition</i></div>

As a control, I targeted the exact same audience with each ad and ran them with the same budget for the same period of time. I also showed those who clicked on the ad the exact same landing page. This was I could evaluate the most important variable: interest in the ad. Because I was interested in people who would want to download and use the app, **I looked at not only how many people clicked on the ad and the cost per click but also the cost per conversion rate** (what percentage of those people tried to download the app after they got to the landing page).

|                      | One-Off Experience Ad |     Commuting Ad      |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **People Reached**   |          1147         |          1401         |
| **Link Clicks**      |           11          |           43          |
| **Cost per Click**   |         $0.45         |         $0.12         |
| **Total Views**      |           12          |           44          |
| **Conversions**      |           3           |           13          |
| **Conversion Rate**  |           25%         |           30%         |

<div class="caption"><i>Advertising results showing the commuting ad resulting in higher conversion rates and lower cost per click</i></div>

With a lower cost per result, higher number of link clicks, and higher conversion rate, **people were more interested in the app for commuting** rather than for one-off experiences. This is especially interesting because as the technology of flying vehicles becomes more mainstream, it's likely that the tide would shift even further away from the one-off experience. Overall, this experiment validated the value proposition of an app for booking an autonomous flying shuttle as part of a multi-modal route.


## The Outcome {#outcome}

By the end of this project, I was **able to validate the value proposition** of an app for booking an autonomous flying shuttle as part of a multi-modal route and **uncover customer interest in a subscription-based pricing model**. 

Because this was a university project, this app was not developed (but you can [check out the final prototype here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/1d063ac5-f558-44fd-4af5-f6cddd822fe0-6b37/?fullscreen&hints=off)). If I were to continue working on this project, **I would conduct more thorough user interviews with a larger sample size** to validate that the changes I made after the first round of interviews addressed real customer needs and to uncover additional areas for improvement. If the app were developed, **I would use customer reviews and complaints** in addition to usability testing to assess the impact of the design on business objectives.

Flying autonomous vehicles will be here before we know it, and I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to explore how we might make this technology more accessible and affordable for the general public in Los Angeles. 

### Lessons Learned

* The fastest way to learn to prototype in Adobe XD is to ask a bunch of strangers to use your creation and then notice/hear all the ways it could be better. 
* Take the time to consider what the biggest question/variable/risk is associated with your value proposition. Before the campaign described above, I actually ran two other campaigns where I learned nothing because I didn't have a clear hypothesis.
* User research can still be conducted in the midst of a pandemic if you're flexible and a bit creative.
