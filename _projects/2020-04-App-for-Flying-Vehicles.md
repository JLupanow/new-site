title: Mobile App for Booking Flying Vehicles
subtitle: I explored the future of mobility in Los Angeles, focused on the way users could gain access to affordable, cutting-edge modes of transportation.
role: This was a solo university project. I worked on the customer discovery, competitive analysis, high fidelity prototyping, and online user research.
timeline: January through May 2020

description: Autonomous flying vehicles are the way of the future, but what will using these vehicles look like? In this project, I explored what users would want out of an app for booking one of these vehicles as part of a multi-modal trip planner. Think of it as Uber meets CityMapper with the addition of autonomous flying vehicles. This was a solo university project from January to May 2020.

## The Challenge

Why did this project need to happen? 
What was the goal and why? 
What specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points was I trying to meet? 
Who was the user/customer? What was my role? Who else worked on this? 
Were there any unique or limiting factors like budget, time, time zones, etc.

## The Process

1. [Get to know the customers](#customers)
2. [Analyze the Competition](#competition)
3. [Design a High Fidelity Prototype](#prototype)
4. [Conduct Online User Research](#research)

#### Get to Know the Customers {#customers}

There is only so much you can learn about customers needs and goals by reading about LA transportation online. I **developed a provisional persona based on my online research**, but I needed to know more about what everyday people expected from these futuristic modes of transportation. Would they anticipate them working like modern public transit, coming and going from common stops, or would they expect them to be more like Uber, calling up a vehicle on demand? To answer this question, **I hit the streets of downtown Los Angeles to catch my would-be customers and ask them some questions** to learn more about their current transportation experience and their expectations for the future of LA transit.

My customer discovery process included 10 individuals. I found that:

> 40% of those interviewed thought the flying vehicles would work like modern public transit while 60% thought they would call up a vehicle like they would an Uber.

Based on the information I gathered during the interviews, I was also able to **fine-tune my persona**, which would be critical to designing an app that addressed real user needs and behaviors. Meet the efficient millenials. They worry about the safety of these flying vehicles but also know that they're not very far off in the future. The like to relax or work while in transit and need quick and affordable ways to get around, even if it means carpooling occasionally.

Though I would have loved to talk to even more people to confirm my findings, **this was enough data for me to get started shaping a solution that I could get in front of more people**. But first I had to make sure I was developing a unique solution. To do that, I needed to look at the current marketplace.

#### Analyze the Competition {#competition}

Armed with an understanding of the problems faced by my persona and their interest in my value proposition, I moved on to conducting a competitive analysis. Though the technology is still a ways off, there was a surprisingly large existing market for autonomous flying vehicles (both the manufacturing and design of the vehicles themselves as well as solutions for bringing the technology to the public). I evaluated X direct competitors and Y indirect competitors, comparing their funding, revenue streams, prototypes demonstrated, competitive advantages, and customer reviews (where appropriate). **The biggest competitor to this value proposition of "Uber for Autonomous Flying Vehicles" was, unsurprisingly, Uber itself**. With $24.7 billion in funding and an enormous existing customer base, Uber Air (also called Uber Elevate) was a formidable competitor.

However, **they were planning to charge users $5 per mile to fly**, which would be **inaccessible for many of Los Angeles commuters**.

Because Uber Air was not addressing the needs of the budget-conscious customer, I decided to pivot on my value proposition to better address the needs of this population.

> By moving away from Uber for flying autonomous cars and transitioning to an autonomous flying shuttle system with lower flat rates and discount passes, I was better able to address the needs of more budget-conscious customers.

This **change in value proposition stemmed from the strong interest during customer discovery in these vehicles functioning like modern public transportation and differentiated this app** from the rest of the market. 

Satisfied that the new value proposition was sufficiently unique in the marketplace, I began creating a high-fidelty prototype I could get in front of potential customers.

#### Design a High Fidelity Prototype {#prototype}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
What did you learn? For example, what would you do differently next time?
In between each part of your process, explain why you went onto the next step of the process — did you run out of time? Did you feel your data was statistically significant?

## The Outcome {#outcome}

Project success metrics and awards. 
What happened in the end? 
Were the goals achieved? 
Were there lessons learned? 
How did the project affect the users and the business? 
If you don’t have any way of showing the impact of your project, lay out how you would measure the impact. 
Explain the direction the product is heading or talk about features that are coming up in future iterations if possible
What insights have you gathered along the way?
Especially knowing what you do now, what would you change?
Did you learn a new method or practice?
Maybe you figured out a better way to conduct user testing, communicate with project managers?
How did you handle scope creep or miscommunication between teams?
