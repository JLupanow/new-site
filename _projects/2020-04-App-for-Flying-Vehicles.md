description: Autonomous flying vehicles are the way of the future, but what will using these vehicles look like? In this project, I explored what users would want out of an app for booking one of these vehicles as part of a multi-modal trip planner. Think of it as Uber meets CityMapper with the addition of autonomous flying vehicles. This was a school project.

## The Challenge

Why did this project need to happen? What was the goal and why? Who was the user/customer? What was my role? Who else worked on this? Were there any unique or limiting factors like budget, time, time zones, etc.

## The Process

1. [Get to know the customers](#test)
2. [Analyze the Competition](#competition)
3. [Design a High Fidelity Prototype](#prototype)
4. [Conduct Online User Research](#research)

#### Get to Know the Customers {#customers}

The step title should be the reason for doing the step or what was learned. A single headline/sentence. Or put a block quote at the end with the major finding of that step.
What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
What did you learn? For example, what would you do differently next time?

#### Analyze the Competition {#competition}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
What did you learn? For example, what would you do differently next time?

#### Design a High Fidelity Prototype {#prototype}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
What did you learn? For example, what would you do differently next time?

#### Conduct Online User Research {#research}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
What did you learn? For example, what would you do differently next time?

## The Outcome

What happened in the end? Were the goals achieved? Were there lessons learned?
