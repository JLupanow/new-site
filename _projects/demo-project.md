## The Challenge

Why did this project need to happen? 
What was the goal and why? 
What specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points was I trying to meet? 
Who was the user/customer? What was my role? Who else worked on this? 
Were there any unique or limiting factors like budget, time, time zones, etc.

## The Process

1. [Step 1: Present tense Verb+noun](#link1)
2. [Step 2: Present tense Verb+noun](#link2)
3. [Step 3: Present tense Verb+noun](#link3)

### Step 1 {#link1}

If someone walked in off the street, with no background in UX, your process should make sense to them
What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
In between each part of your process, explain why you went onto the next step of the process — did you run out of time? Did you feel your data was statistically significant?

### Step 2 {#link2}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
In between each part of your process, explain why you went onto the next step of the process — did you run out of time? Did you feel your data was statistically significant?

### Step 3 {#link3}

What did you do? For example, what research method did you use?
Why did you do it?  For example, why did you choose that research method?
What was the result?  For example, did you achieve your research goals?
In between each part of your process, explain why you went onto the next step of the process — did you run out of time? Did you feel your data was statistically significant?

## The Outcome {#outcome}

Project success metrics and awards. 
What happened in the end? 
Were the goals achieved? 
Were there lessons learned? 
How did the project affect the users and the business? 
If you don’t have any way of showing the impact of your project, lay out how you would measure the impact. 
Explain the direction the product is heading or talk about features that are coming up in future iterations if possible
What insights have you gathered along the way?
Especially knowing what you do now, what would you change?
Did you learn a new method or practice?
Maybe you figured out a better way to conduct user testing, communicate with project managers?
How did you handle scope creep or miscommunication between teams?

### Lessons Learned

* The fastest way to learn to prototype in Adobe XD is to ask a bunch of strangers to use your creation and then notice/hear all the ways it could be better. 
* Take the time to consider what the biggest question/variable/risk is associated with your value proposition. Before the campaign described above, I actually ran two other campaigns where I learned nothing because I didn't have a clear hypothesis.
* User research can still be conducted in the midst of a pandemic if you're flexible and a bit creative.

## Possible Formatting (REMOVE EVERYTHING BELOW)

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

![](/images/demo.jpg)

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

#### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a simple Liquid snippet in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}
```
{% endraw %}

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.


#### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg
	"
%}

#### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

{% include post-components/video.html
	url = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/270725085?color=6c6e95&title=0&byline=0"
	full_width = true
%}

### Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.
Why not put them to use on your new website?
