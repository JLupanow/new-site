      <h2 class="title">Hi, I’m Jessica.</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m a junior designer, researcher, and strategist specializing in digital products for health and social issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        My skills include competitive research & value proposition identification, customer discovery & persona creation, wireframing & prototyping, and user research & usability testing. Before working in UX, I was a doctoral researcher in socially assistive robotics. This is where I learned how to engage with users to collect useful qualitative and quantitative data about their interactions with technology. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently I'm designing thoughtful experiences as a part of <a class="about__link" href="https://jaimelevy.com/" target="_blank">Jaime Levy Consulting</a> and working with freelance clients to identify areas for growth in existing products and help bring new product ideas to life.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        I’m passionate about devising clean, straightforward designs backed by research that meet the users needs as well as your business goals.
      </p> -->

      <!-- In my spare time you can find me creating copycat Starbucks recipes at home, walking my newly adopted dog, or binge watching comedy specials and old crime shows. -->

      <p>I’d love to learn about your company and see how I can help!</p>
